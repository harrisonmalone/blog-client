        <p>This site! My basic blog that pulls posts from an S3 bucket.</p>
        <p>
          In 2021 I'm keen to write new technical posts on a weekly basis. I'll
          also just be posting some random thoughts on things every now and
          then.

        <p>An Apple Music client.</p>
        <p>
          Over the holidays I kind of randomly decided to experiment with
          Apple's MusicKit library. Starting off the small the app slowly become
          a fully fledged tool for playing and archiving music.
        </p>
        <p>There's three key features:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Organizing and updating data about albums in my library, this data
            includes the Wikipedia entry for the album (which I often enjoy
            reading) and reviews
          </li>
          <li>Playing albums through the Apple Music API</li>
          <li>Sorting and displaying albums in a nice manner</li>
        </ol>

        <p>A photo's app to store memories in.</p>
        <p>
          The idea sprung about as I basically wanted to have a client app that
          interfaced with an S3 bucket which is where I archive all my images.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also wanted to have a digital memory of one single day represented
          through a date, a photo and a description of what happened that day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app complements the way in which I handle photos using a script to
          rename the actual image files and then uploading them to S3 using
          Transmit.

        <h3>Wedding Gift Registry</h3>
        <p>
          A friends wedding was coming up and I saw he was using Wordpress to
          organize the gifts people were giving at the event. I suggested I
          could do something nicer! The gift registry database was seeded with a
          spreadsheet of values and then the site updates when users select a
          gift. Users can either buy the gift outright or ask for contributors.
